# Amazon Databricks End-to-End Project

This repository showcases an **end-to-end data analytics and engineering workflow** using **Databricks**. The project demonstrates how to **create a database, design tables, normalize data, insert and process datasets, analyze data, and build dashboards** in a scalable environment. It provides a complete workflow for handling data from ingestion to visualization.  

---

## Technologies & Tools

- **Platform:** Databricks (Free Edition)  
- **Database & Tables:** SQL in Databricks  
- **Visualization & Dashboards:** Databricks visualization tools  
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Project Workflow

### 1. Database & Table Creation
- Design a relational database structure.  
- Create tables to store raw and processed data.  
- Define primary keys and foreign keys to maintain relationships.  

### 2. Data Normalization
- Clean raw datasets for duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.  
- Normalize data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity before insertion.  
- Split large datasets into multiple related tables when necessary.  

### 3. Data Insertion
- Load cleaned and normalized data into tables using SQL.  
- Ensure referential integrity through proper relationships between tables.  

### 4. Data Analysis
- Use SQL to query and aggregate data.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.  
- Join tables to derive insights across the database.  

### 5. Dashboard Creation & Visualization
- Build interactive dashboards in Databricks.  
- Visualize data using bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, and other charts.  
- Summarize key metrics for easy reporting and decision-making.
